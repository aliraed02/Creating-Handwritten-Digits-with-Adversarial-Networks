# Creating-Handwritten-Digits-with-Adversarial-Networks
This project explores the generation of realistic handwritten digits using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The objective is to delve into the capabilities of GANs in creating synthetic handwritten digits that closely resemble the patterns found in the MNIST dataset.
